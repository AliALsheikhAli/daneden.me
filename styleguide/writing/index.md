title: Writing Styleguide
---

Having taken the time to outline the [visual styleguide](/styleguide) of my site, I thought it would only be fair to create a writing styleguide, too – for myself, as a personal reference, and for those interested in the writing styles and habits of others.

## Language, Voice, and Persona
I write with the intent of coming across a few ways:

- Formal, but not intimidating
- Trustworthy
- Honest
- Friendly

With this persona in mind, correct English grammar and language is forefront, with dashes of humour and colloquialism where appropriate. (That means no effing and jeffing.)

## Grammar
Prim and proper grammar, of course. Full stops, commas to ease juxtapositions, lift and separate phrases, and separate listed phrases or words. I’m an advocate of the [Oxford comma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma).

Unless part of a phrase or word group, punctuation always falls outside of a hyperlink. For example:

{% highlight html %}
<a href="some-link.html">This</a>, <a href="some-link.html">That</a>, and others.
{% endhighlight %}

The last words in any given paragraph or other block-level elements are separated by a non-breaking space to prevent widows.

“Smart” quotes are preferred over straight quotes. A period is followed by a single space. N-dashes (–) are used for short breaks in text (similar to parentheses), and m-dashes (—) are used to cite authors and origins of quotes, etc.

Unless at the end of a sentence, terminal punctuation exists outside a set of parentheses. For example:

> I knew it to be true (though I wish it weren’t.)

Semicolons are used to separate juxtaposing sentences or phrases, or to separate list items which themselves contain comma-separated words or phrases. Colons are used to introduce examples and lists. Blockquotes are used to frame non-original and secondary quotes that run longer than a single line.

Paragraphs – regardless of content – must not exceed more than around 10 sentences. Content must flow so that it is neither one long block of text, nor hundreds of separated single-sentence paragraphs.

Horizontal rules should be used to separate content into sections, or draw a rule before adding editorial notes and footnotes.

These guidelines are just that – guidelines – and may be broken where appropriate. They are a mix of my upbringing, lessons learned from doing things the wrong way, and a few resources, including [The Elements of Typographic Style](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326). Happy writing.
