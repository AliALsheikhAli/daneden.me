## Golden Hour
[Golden Hour](https://goldenhour.photos) is a place for me to post some of my favorite and best photographs. They're all
shot at sunrise or sunset, and they're all available to download for personal, non-commercial use (such as your desktop
or mobile wallpaper). [Visit the site](https://goldenhour.photos).

## Gifme
[Gifme](https://gif.daneden.me) is a personal clone/rip-off/emulation of Giphy, the popular gif search engine. Tired of
Giphy's suboptimal Slack integration, I built Gifme as a web app and a [Slack app](https://gif.daneden.me/slack) to
search my own massive gif collection. View the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/daneden/gifme) or

## Scooter
[Scooter](http://dropbox.github.io/scooter/) is an SCSS framework built to provide base styles, CSS components, and
rapid static prototyping for Dropbox. Conceived in an effort to both drastically reduce the amount of new CSS being
written at Dropbox, and to foster and maintain design consistency across Dropbox Web, Scooter encapsulates all of
Dropbox's main UI design patterns in a fraction of the size of the previous CSS.

## Toast
[Toast](http://daneden.github.io/Toast) is a Sass/CSS grid system, designed to be highly customisable, extremely
verbose, and simple-to-use out of the box. It uses no floats, no `first` or `last` classes, and allows nesting.

## Digital Ruin
[Digital Ruin](http://digitalru.in/) is—for lack of a more fitting description—an art project dedicated to giving form
to both real and fictional digital exchanges, with an emphasis on difficult interactions. It’s bleak, and hard to
describe. [Visit the site](http://digitalru.in/).

## Ragged Write
[Ragged Write](http://raggedwrite.net) is a website about typography; a place to share news, reviews, and personal
commentary on the world of typography. Created out of a desire to write about type, as well as maintain a collection of
typographic resources for personal reference. [Visit the site](http://raggedwrite.net).

## Untones
[Untones](http://unton.es/) are occasional, delightful ringtones for mobile devices and beyond. I’ve long been playing
around in sound creation software, and thought I’d make something productive out of the process. The tones are released
in pairs—one for calls, and one for messages/alerts—as often as I feel like it. [Visit the site](http://unton.es).

## Just My Type
[Just My Type](http://justmytype.co) is a library of font pairings from Adobe Typekit and [H&FJ](class:caps)’s
Cloud.Typography. Created out of a desire for a place to keep track of my personal favorite web font pairings, Just My
Type has grown to become a popular typography resource for many web designers. [Visit the site](http://justmytype.co).

## Onword
Tired of only being able to access my iA Writer documents on my iOS devices, I created [Onword](http://onword.co), a
simple web application for writing documents. It was designed and developed in just 10 days, and introduced me to the
world of Ruby. [Visit the site](http://onword.co).

## Webshaped 2012
I was invited to speak at the 2012 [Webshaped](http://webshaped.fi) conference, alongside some incredible folk I've
long admired. It was terrifying, amazing, and I'd love to do it again. My presentation tackled animation on the web,
and how we can delight our audience by integrating animation in our websites and applications. You can
[read more](/2012/05/18/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing/) about my time there.

## Brills
I designed and developed [Brills](http://brills.me) to quench my thirst for a simpler money management application that
worked on all my devices, with a no-nonsense interface. I wrote it in vanilla PHP, before later discovering that
CodeIgniter does a much better job than me at a lot of important stuff, and moving the code onto the framework with
great ease. [Visit the site](http://brills.me).

## Animate.css
During the development of Brills, I found myself spending a lot of time writing CSS animation keyframes. It became quite
a repetitive task, especially with the requirement for multiple keyframe declarations for different browsers. “There
must be an easier way!” I cried, but there wasn't. So I made one.

[Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) is a cross-browser plug-and-play CSS animation library for
delightful animation in websites and web applications. [Visit the site](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).
