My name is Daniel Eden, and I’m a designer with a penchant for the web,
interaction design, and typography. I like [scratching my own itch](/portfolio
"Daniel Eden’s portfolio") and [writing](/blog "Daniel Eden’s blog") about
design, courage, and lack thereof.

I’m currently working in San Francisco for [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com
"Dropbox") as a Designer. More specifically, I work with the Web Experience
team, rearchitecting Dropbox's CSS codebase, providing developer tools for
Dropbox's web engineers, and fostering better collaboration between the
engineering and design teams.

Outside of Dropbox, I work on a few
[side projects](/portfolio "Daniel Eden’s portfolio"), many of which are open
source. I also spend a lot of time thinking about social justice and diversity
in the tech industry.

Take a look at
