My name is Daniel Eden, and I’m a designer with a penchant for the web, interaction design, and typography. I like [scratching my own itch](/portfolio) and [writing](/blog) about design, courage, and lack thereof.

I’m currently working in San Francisco for [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) as a Designer, trying to make things make sense. If you want to, you can view and download [my résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf) or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_dte).
