My name is Daniel Eden, and I’m a designer with a penchant for the web, interaction design, and typography. I like [scratching my own itch](/portfolio) and [writing](/blog) about design, courage, and lack thereof.

I’m currently working in San Francisco for [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) as a Designer. More specifically, I work with the Network Growth and Revenue teams, helping to grow our user base, help those users make the most of Dropbox, and then monetize our most engaged users.

Outside of Dropbox, I work on a few [side projects](/portfolio), many of which are open source. I also spend a lot of time thinking about social justice and diversity in the tech industry.

Take a look at [my résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf) or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_dte).
