My name is Daniel Eden, and I'm a designer. I specialise in web and interaction design, and have a strong passion for typography—on and off the web. I like [scratching my own itch](/portfolio) and [writing](/blog) about design, courage, and lack thereof. I also like Disney, dogs, and looking up.

I’m currently working in San Francisco for [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) as a Designer. If you want to, you can view and download [my résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf).

I talk about the things I love (and—more often—the things I hate) on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_dte). I publish my most recent works-in-progress for critique on [Dribbble.](http://dribbble.com/dte) I write code and put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/daneden/). Nothing out of the ordinary.

I’m marrying a talented artist and animator named [Emily](http://twitter.com/iamemliy) quite soon. We’re both from Manchester, UK. She likes horror movies. I do not.

If you want to have a chat, you can always email me at [dan.eden@me.com](mailto:dan.eden@me.com).

One last thing; the source code for my entire site is available to view over [on GitHub](https://github.com/daneden/daneden.me). Take a look, suggest improvements, and stay curious.
