Daniel Eden is a Designer with a penchant for the web, typography, and
interaction design. He prefers to refer to himself in the first person.

I'm currently living in Oakland, California and working as a Designer for
[Facebook](https://facebook.com). I help to create and maintain the Facebook
Design System: a set of components, patterns, guidance, and tools to help
hundreds of product teams build experiences for billions of people.

Previously, I worked as a Designer and Engineer for
[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com). I specialize in Design Systems: how they break,
the teams that maintain them, and how they work at scale and across mediums.

I spend my time [Tweeting](http://twitter.com/_dte "@_dte on Twitter"), taking
[photographs](https://photos.daneden.me/ "Daniel's Photography"), making
[art](https://art.daneden.me/ "Daniel's generative art"), and [writing
code](https://github.com/daneden "daneden on GitHub").  I also [write](/blog
"Daniel's blog posts") about design, courage, and lack thereof.

I'm currently unavailable for work, but you can take a look at [my
résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf "Daniel Eden’s résumé") anyway.
