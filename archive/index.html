<p>Welcome to the Archives. Here you’ll find every post I’ve written on the site. Even the ones I’m shameful of. I’ve learned a lot since writing a lot of these words. Judge not by these articles.</p>

<ul class="unl post-list">
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <li class="post-list__item ml">
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">
      <span class="b m0">{{ post.title }}</span>
      <span class="meta h4 b">{{ post.date | date: "%A %-d %B %Y" }}</span>
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
