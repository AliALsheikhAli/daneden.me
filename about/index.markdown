![This is my face. There are many like it but this one is mine.](http://daneden.me/uploads/2011/09/Portrait.jpg)

Hello. My name is Daniel Eden, and I'm a designer.

I'm also blessed with the curiosity and brainpower to execute my ideas through code. In other words, I do a little development as well. In 2013, I graduated from Nottingham Trent University with a 1st class degree in Digital Media Technology BSc, and was awarded a prize for having the highest marks in my cluster. I was also a finalist for .net Magazine’s “Brilliant Newcomer of The Year” award.

Born and raised in Manchester UK, I'm currently working hard at the things I love. You can view [my résumé](http://cl.ly/OlXO), if you’re into that sort of thing.

I say a lot of things on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_dte). I show off my design work-in-progress on [Dribbble.](http://dribbble.com/dte) You can subscribe to my updates on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/daniel.eden), take a look at my photos on [my photo blog](http://photos.daneden.me/), take a listen to my musical preferences on [Rdio](http://rdio.com/people/daneden), listen to music I've made myself on [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/d4te), and endorse me on [Zerply](http://zerp.ly/dte). I also write a lot of code and put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/daneden). Sometimes, I write more thought-out and refined posts about my thoughts and experiences. You can find those on [Medium](http://medium.com/@_dte).

If you want to talk about design, my work, or what I had for breakfast, you can email me at [dan.eden@me.com](mailto:dan.eden@me.com)
