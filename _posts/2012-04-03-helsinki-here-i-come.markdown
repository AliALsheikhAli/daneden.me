title: Helsinki, Here I Come

If you follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_dte) or [dribbble](http://dribbble.com/daneden), you probably knew this already.

I'm very excited (and terrified) to announce that I'll be speaking at this year's [Webshaped](http://webshaped.fi/) conference in Helsinki, Finland. I'm very nervous, since this will be the first time I speak publicly, but I'm sure it'll be an incredible and enjoyable experience.

I hope to see a few familiar faces in Helsinki in a Month's time. Wish me luck!
