title: Twenty-thirteen
---

To say the last twelve months have been some of the most sublime and surreal of my life so far would be an understatement. I owe this to a few things; the support of my friends, family, and my loving partner, as well as the continued encouragement of my peers and mentors. I have so many of you to thank, so thank you. Truly and eternally – thank you so much.

Here are just a few of my highlights from 2013.

Pictured: design heroes [Russ Maschmeyer](http://twitter.com/strangenative) & [Jessica Hische](http://twitter.com/jessicahische), and [Emily](http://twitter.com/iamemliy) (you’ll be seeing more of her face here)" %}
