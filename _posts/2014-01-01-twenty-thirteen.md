To say the last twelve months have been some of the most sublime and surreal of my life so far would be an understatement. I owe this to a few things; the support of my friends, family, and my loving partner, as well as the continued encouragement of my peers and mentors. I have so many of you to thank, so thank you. Truly and eternally – thank you so much.

Here are just a few of my highlights from 2013.

Pictured: design heroes [Russ Maschmeyer](http://twitter.com/strangenative) & [Jessica Hische](http://twitter.com/jessicahische), and [Emily](http://twitter.com/iamemliy) (you’ll be seeing more of her face here)" 2013/01/DSC06336.jpg class="imgbleed" %}

{% picture "Somehow, I was nominated for net Magazine’s “Brilliant Newcome of The Year” award. Though I didn’t win, it was an incredible honour, and wonderful to meet old friends again." 2014/01/net-awards.jpg %}

{% picture "In the summer, I asked [Emily](http://twitter.com/iamemliy) to marry me. Amazingly, she said yes, which was cause for celebration. We’re making plans for a 2015 wedding, and we couldn’t be happier." 2014/01/engagement.jpg class="imgbleed" %}
