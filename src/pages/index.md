Daniel Eden is writing, thinking, and talking about Design Systems: how they
break, how they scale, and the people that maintain them. He also prefers to
talk about himself in the first person.

I’m currently living in London, U.K. and working as a Design Lead for
[Facebook](https://facebook.com). I help to create and maintain the Design
System for Facebook’s Ads and Business products. Our team produces components,
patterns, guidance, and tools to help hundreds of product teams build
experiences for billions of people. Previously, I worked as a Designer and
Engineer for [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com).

I spend my time [Tweeting](http://twitter.com/_dte "@_dte on Twitter"), taking
[photographs](https://photos.daneden.me/ "Daniel’s Photography"), making
[art](https://art.daneden.me/ "Daniel’s generative art") & [music](http://soundcloud.com/d4te "Daniel’s music"),
and [writing code](https://github.com/daneden "daneden on GitHub"). I also
[write](/blog "Daniel’s blog posts") about design, courage, and lack thereof.

I’m currently unavailable for work, but you can take a look at [my
résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq431p4ey1b1ayu/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf "Daniel Eden’s résumé") anyway.
