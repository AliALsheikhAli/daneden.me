# Geodesic

In 2018, Facebook’s disparate design systems were merged into a single,
unified system. However, shortly after the merge, we found that the unified
system proved to fall short for different business- and enterprise-specific
needs.

We decided to develop a design system specifically for Facebook’s Ads and
Business products. The system, named Geodesic, was soon adopted across dozens
of Facebook’s Ads and Business products, and continues to help drive enhanced
and cohesive user experiences for Facebook’s advertising and marketing
customers.

My responsibilities in Geodesic began by helping to refine the visual language
and system components. In 2019, I became a Product Design Lead, responsible for
ensuring Geodesic’s strategic success, helping run support programs, and
supporting project roadmapping, sequencing, and coordination.

## Refining Geodesic’s Style

From Geodesic’s early days, we knew we wanted to make a design system that
supported the level of efficiency expected of high-quality enterprise
applications, while at the same time not becoming sterile or lacking warmth.
One of my main contributions in the early development of Geodesic was exploring
principle factors of the system, including components such as cards and other
common layer types, as well as exploring animations to help make the system
appear more natural and elegant.

Below are some samples of work that emerged from these explorations.
