It's no secret that learning JavaScript (and React) in 2020 is confusing at best
and downright intimidating at worst. Multiple technologies, tools, and
approaches tend to get bundled together in React tutorials, and if you haven't
written JavaScript for a few years, it can feel like a totally new landscape.

In this post, I wanted to take a look at a very simple React component and walk
step-by-step through the parts of the code that are unique to either:

-   React
-   Typed programming (using type checkers such as Flow or TypeScript)
-   "Modern" JavaScript (what's often referred to as "ES6", but essentially
    covers any JavaScript language features that have changed since I first
    learned JavaScript around 2013)

Here's what we'll be looking at, with some markers/annotations in place:

```tsx
// |--- 1 ---|    |--------- 2 ---------||-- 3 --|| 4 |
const Component = ({ children, hasPadding }: Props) => {
    return (
        // |--- 5 ---| |---------- 6 ----------|
        <div className={hasPadding && "padding"}>// | 7 |{children}</div>
    )
}
```

## 1: Constants

The first marker in our code highlights a keyword that may be new to you:
`const`.

Constants in JavaScript are essentially variables which, once assigned, cannot
be changed. In the past you may have written or seen code that looks like this:

```js
var number = 1
number = 2

console.log(number) // => 2
```

There are sometimes cases where you need to change a variable after it's been
assigned; but most of the time, once its been set, you don't need to change it.
In fact, leaving it open to change can result in unexpected results. This is
where constants can come in handy.

```js
const number = 1
number = 2 // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

Nowadays, many people follow a rule of "always prefer `const`". If you do need
to assign a variable that may need to change later, `let` is another keyword
that is preferred over `var`:

```js
let number = 1
number = 2

console.log(number) // => 2
```

There are some more differences worth learning about between `var`, `let`, and
`const`, and plenty of [material already written](https://ui.dev/var-let-const/)
on the subject.

## 2, 3, and 4: Arrow Functions

The markers indicating parts 2, 3, and 4 are all part of an expression pattern
called _arrow functions_. You may be used to seeing or writing functions like
this:

```js
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y
}

add(2, 2) // => 4
```

Arrow functions are "syntactical sugar"
